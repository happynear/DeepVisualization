Visualization for the classifier neurons in any networks.

This is the codes for reproducing the results in my paper, 
Visualizing Deep Neural Network by Alternately Image Blurring and Deblurring (arxiv link comming soon).

Please feel free to modify the switches and paramters in `inceptionism_big.m` and see what happens. 

Some results are uploaded to [Baidu Photo](http://xiangce.baidu.com/picture/album/list/41344a5443cc313414de9559899e213417674a76).

Here is the figure displayed in my paper for comparison. The (c) rows are created by [Inceptionism](https://github.com/google/deepdream) , (d) rows's algorithm is similar with https://github.com/auduno/deepdraw and (e) rows are my results.
